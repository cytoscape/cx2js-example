One of the visualization tools available in CRAVAT is MuPIT, a 3D structure viewer that shows the position of the mutation in the structure of the affected protein (in the cases a structure is available on the Protein Data Bank). Many mutations are located in known binding sites for drugs and peptidomimetic inhibitors, and the user might wonder how these mutations would affect the binding of these ligands of interest. DINC is a parallelized meta-docking tool that can quickly predict the binding mode of a receptor-ligand complex, providing an estimated biding affinity. A connection between CRAVAT and DINC, or more specifically, between MuPIT and DINC, could allow the user of CRAVAT to not only visualize the location of the mutations of interest, but also to trigger docking jobs on DINC to compare the binding of a drug of interest to the mutated protein versus the wild-type, for instance. Or to compare the impact of different mutations on the binding of a given inhibitor. Or to screen different inhibitors and find the one that is more likely to bind to the mutated protein. We can also discuss interactions on the reverse direction. After submitting a regular docking job to DINC, the user could be given the option to search on CRAVAT if the predicted binding residues are known sites of mutation, and maybe select other variants that would be of interest for his docking experiment."}, {"po":157,"n":"Status","v":"Exists"}, {"po":157,"n":"Suggested By","v":"Bradley Broom"}, {"po":157,"n":"name","v":"Galaxy (Connected with) NG-CHM"}, {"po":157,"n":"Evidence","v":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29092932"}, {"po":157,"n":"Why?","v":"To enable NG-CHMs to be created within a Galaxy workflow"}, {"po":124,"n":"Status","v":"Exists"}, {"po":124,"n":"Suggested By","v":"Brigitte Raumann"}, {"po":124,"n":"name","v":"Galaxy (interacts with) Globus"}, {"po":124,"n":"Evidence","v":"https://www.globusgenomics.org/genomics/"}, {"po":124,"n":"Why?","v":"Globus Genomic is an genomics analysis platform that integrates the data management provided by Globus, an extensible analysis environment provided by Galaxy, and compute and storage capabilities powered by Amazon Web Services."}, {"po":122,"n":"Status","v":"Exists"}, {"po":122,"n":"Suggested By","v":"Jeremy Goecks"}, {"po":122,"n":"name","v":"Galaxy (Connected with) Galaxy-P multi-omics"}, {"po":122,"n":"Evidence","v":"http://galaxyp.org"}, {"po":122,"n":"Why?","v":"Galaxy-P multi-omics builds on the Galaxy platform"}, {"po":121,"n":"Status","v":"Exists"}, {"po":121,"n":"Suggested By","v":"Jeremy Goecks"}, {"po":121,"n":"name","v":"Galaxy (Connected with) CRAVAT"}, {"po":121,"n":"Evidence","v":"https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu"}, {"po":121,"n":"Why?","v":"CRAVAT can be run in Galaxy"}, {"po":120,"n":"Status","v":"Exists"}, {"po":120,"n":"Suggested By","v":"Jeremy Goecks"}, {"po":120,"n":"name","v":"Galaxy (Connected with) Trinity"}, {"po":120,"n":"Evidence","v":"https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu"}, {"po":120,"n":"Why?","v":"Trinity tools can be run in Galaxy"}, {"po":119,"n":"Status","v":"Proposed"}, {"po":119,"n":"Suggested By","v":"Alexej Abyzov"}, {"po":119,"n":"name","v":"CNVnator (Connected with) JBrowse"}, {"po":119,"n":"Why?","v":"To visualize CNV in the context of other data;

of SVs (and simpler variants), along with genome-situated evidence such as RNAseq reads. In spite of being DNA-oriented, current efforts on JBrowse 2 are aiming on the \"protein space\", including plans for building a mini-protein browser. In addition, there are plans for a JBrowse protein viewer. DINC is a parallelized meta-docking tool to predict binding modes of a receptor-ligand complexes and providing structure-based biding affinities. We are working to expand the scope and functionalities of this tool, in order to make DINC a reference tool for structural analysis in cancer research. For that, it would be useful to have connections with the protein visualization tool inside JBrowse, which in turn will be connected to other ITCR resources, such as the Clinical Interpretation of Variants in Cancer (CIViC).
